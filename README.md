Test Driven Development.

Tests serve 3 purposes
Acceptance Criteria - Ensures developed code meets specifications
Regression Testing - Ensures new changes don't impact previous developed code
Documentation - Demonstrates how the application behaves

## Quick-start

## Requirements

## Naming conventions

To achieve a proper documentation, a good staring point is to create naming conventions for the tests.

1. What is being tested
2. What is the scenario (input)
3. What should be the outcome (Output)

Naming conventions example: testingX_scenario_outcome
